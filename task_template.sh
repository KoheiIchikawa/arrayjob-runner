# There's no need to explicitly specify an exit status if you use the exit status
# of the last command as the exit status returned by this script. 
# If a command in the middle of the script fails and you want to treat it as a 
# failure of the script, ensure you explicitly return a non-zero exit status.
# Or consider running the following command at the beginning:
# set -eu -o pipefail
