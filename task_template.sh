#!/bin/bash

# This script processes a single task within an ArrayJob. 
# It accepts a single command-line argument and processes it accordingly.
# If the processing fails, please ensure the script returns a non-zero exit status.
# If you rely on the exit status of the last command in this script, there's no need
# to explicitly return the exit status.
# However, if a command fails mid-script and you want to treat that as a failure of
# the script, explicitly return a non-zero exit status.
# Or consider commenting out the following line:
# set -eu -o pipefail

TASK="$1"

# === BEGIN USER EDIT ===
# Add your implementation for a task here
echo "Processing: $TASK"



# === END USER EDIT ===
